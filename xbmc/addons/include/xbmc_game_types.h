    * (or something similar) is being placed. For a touch-centric device,
    * coordinates reported are the coordinates of the press.
    *
    * Coordinates in X and Y are reported as [-0x7fff, 0x7fff]. -0x7fff
    * corresponds to the far left/top of the screen, and 0x7fff corresponds
    * to the far right/bottom of the screen. The "screen" is the area that is
    * passed to the frontend and later displayed on the monitor. The frontend

    * (X, Y) = (-0x7fff, -0x7fff) will correspond to the top-left pixel of
    * the game image, etc.
    *
    * To check if the pointer coordinates are valid (e.g. a touch display
    * actually being touched), PRESSED returns 1 or 0. If using a mouse,
    * PRESSED will usually correspond to the left mouse button. PRESSED will
    * only return 1 if the pointer is inside the game screen.
    *
    * For multi-touch, the index variable can be used to successively query
    * more presses. If index = 0 returns true for _PRESSED, coordinates can
    * be extracted with _X, _Y for index = 0. One can then query _PRESSED,
    * _X, _Y with index = 1, and so on. Eventually _PRESSED will return false
