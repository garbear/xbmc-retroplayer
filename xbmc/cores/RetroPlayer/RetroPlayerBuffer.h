 * Audio and video buffers in RetroPlayer are out-of-order paged ring buffers,

 * to track the order of the packets, allowing for single-copy and avoiding the
 * need to constantly allocate small blocks of memory for each packet. This
 * strategy is well-suited for RetroPlayer, as game clients generally deliver
 * identically-sized packets at a relatively uniform rate. All public methods
 * are thread-safe, which removes the need for syncronization strategies in
 * RetroPlayerAudio and RetroPlayerVideo.
 *
 * Subclasses provide IsFull() to indicate that incoming packets should
 * overwrite existing data, allowing them to determine the size of the buffer
 * (e.g. by packet count or buffer size).
